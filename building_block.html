										<h1>Building Block Project</h1>
									</header>
									<h2>Inspiration</h2>
									<p>This assignment was part of a tinkering course I took at university.  LEGO is one of the many versatile
										 materials for construction and is very useful for tinkering. It is also known for designing and manufacturing toy building blocks. 
										The aim of this assignment was to  create a design for my own building and showcase the process. </p>
									<div class="box alt">
										<h3>Starting point</h3>
										<p>I wanted to design something interactive without re-inventing the wheel so I 
											started by drawing 2 simple block, and tried to focus on designing a
											 way for the blocks connect to each other, similar to what Lego blocks do. A simple block drawing with a connection point was my starting point.</p>
										<div class="row gtr-50 gtr-uniform">
											<div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/building_block_basic.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
											<p>This led me to thinking about how to design parts that would fit ‘snap together’ and be  easy to take apart. 
												Taking notes from LEGO, I decided to design blocks that had holes and ‘outie things’ so that they would be able to mesh well and be taken apart easily.
												 One design was an ‘inverse block’ which was discarded because it could not join with other blocks, 
												but some of the ideas were kept due to the inside of the block being hallow. </p>
											<div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/building_block_double.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
											<div class="col-5"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/building_block_inverse.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
											<!-- Break -->
											<p> The designs illustrated how I wanted to build a ‘binding’ mechanism within the block so it 
												could attach itself to other blocks. So a building block node was designed with an outie thing, a hole and a hallow bottom to allow another block to attach to it.</p>

											<div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/building_block1.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
											<div class="col-3"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/building_block3.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
											<!-- Break -->
											 <p>I then went on a tangent and started thinking about how the block could be made to be collapsable and more interactive whilst
												 still having that snap and binidng element to it. This them got me thinking about snap fit designs and how i could 'build a basic 
												 block from 6 pieces of wood without using glue. A puzzle like structure came to mind and reminded me of a flag mural I designed when I was in high school. The idea of the flag mural is that everyone is part of the same 'puzzle' 
												 but each person comes from a different piece of the world. Taking an idea from mural and applying it to the block. I tried to design a building block that could be assembled using 6 pieces.
